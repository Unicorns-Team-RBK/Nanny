      <h2>OUR SCREENING PROCESS</h2>
      <p>We follow a rigorous screening process to vet the qualifications and 
        background of everyone we invite to join our selective community. 
        We review over one hundred applications per week and interview a select number 
        of applicants in person at our Union Square offices. Upon a successful interview, 
        we speak with a minimum of two child care-related references, conduct background 
        checks, and finish with an evaluation from a SmartSitting Director to ensure that 
        they are best matched with SmartSitting families. We believe that nanny  hires 
        should be treated with the same level of professionalism as corporate hires.</p>

  <h3>OUR NANNIES</h3>
  <p>When we meet with nannies , we’re looking for a lot more than just standard qualifications. In fact, our recruitment directors won’t lower their standards to meet demand. We'll hand select our top candidates for your family, and we stand behind every candidate that we present. We think they’re all pretty special.
